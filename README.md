### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Tommy Nguyen and I am trying to advance my career through the improvement of my technical skills of SQL and Tableau. This is the journey of my learnings!

A quick summary of me:
- I'm a business analyst with 2.5 years of experience
- Currently learning and improving my knowledge on SQL and Tableau
- I play a lot of games and racket sports (tennis and pickleball)
- A lot of datasets i'll be using will probably be something that pertains to me or things i'm interested in.
